# Todo App

This is a simple Todo app created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to run with the **Live Server** extension. The app allows users to create tasks, mark them as done, and delete tasks. It uses **local storage** to persist task data across sessions in the user's browser.
